How To:
1) Download Android Studio
   https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
2) Launch the downloaded .exe and follow the setup wizard
3) Open an existing Android Studio project -> Demo_v1

4) Go to Tools (top bar) -> Android -> AVD Manager
5) Press Create Virtual Device on the bottom right
6) Select Nexus 6p -> (hit next)
   API Level 25 -> 
   Enter a custom name -> Finish
7) Now you can run the app using Shift+f10 or pressing the play button on the toolbars at the top.
   Select the newly created emulator as deployment target

8) Press the camera button (top right) to select or take a picture to be used in the app
9) Click and drag around the image to find a suitable background color for removal.
   It won't be exact because it's hardcoded at the moment (don't go outside boundaries!)
10) Press the play button for background removal
    Once it's finished, an image will appear below with the background removed
11) The square button dewarps the image based off the rotation and translation matrix extracted from the previous step
12) The last button will save the fragments on the SD card and displays them in the next screen


Inserting an image into Emulator:
1) Make sure the emulator is turned on already
2) Tools -> Android -> Android Device Monitor
3) Click on the folder named sdcard
4) On the top right there are 4 buttons (the two on the right are - and + symbols).
   Select the second button (when hovering over it should say "Push a file onto the device")
   Find the image you want to insert on your computer
5) It may take time for the image to load into the emulator's gallery
